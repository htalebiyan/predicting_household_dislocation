# predicting_household_dislocation
Here I employed XGBoost to find if a household is dislocated based on building damage and socio-economic data for Seaside, OR. The data was acquired from \href{http://incore.ncsa.illinois.edu/}{IN-CORE}. The notebook (full_analysis.ipynb) shows the modeling steps: data cleaning, EDA, training models, tuning models, ensembles, and prediction.
